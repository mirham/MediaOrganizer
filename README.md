## Introduction
MirHam MediaOrganizer is a macOS application...

## Features
- Lets you organize photos and videos in any structure you prefer
- Achieves this using file and EXIF data and a set of flexible rules
- Processes multiple jobs at the same time
- Rapidly processes large media collections thanks to parallel processing
- Automatically restores the original file in case of an error
- Supports both, light and dark theme

Detailed logs help you fine-tune your organization jobs for greater accuracy.

## Compatibility
This application is compatible with macOS 14.5 and above.

## Installation
Download the DMG installer from the [releases](https://github.com/mirham/MediaOrganizer/releases), mount it, and drag and drop the application to the Applications folder. That's it! However, you will need to allow launching applications from unidentified developers to start the application, as I don't have an Apple developer license.

## Improvement
> [!TIP]
> If you have any ideas, thoughts, or concerns, don't hesitate to contact me. I'm happy to help and improve the application.

## Disclaimer
> [!WARNING]
> I'm not a professional Swift developer (though I am a professional .NET developer). All my macOS apps are made for personal use by myself and my family simply because I have the skills to create them (and for fun, of course ðŸ˜Š). If my application has caused any harm, I apologize for that, but please be aware that you use it at your own risk.

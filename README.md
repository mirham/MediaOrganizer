## Disclaimer
> [!WARNING]
> I'm not a professional Swift developer (though I am a professional .NET developer). All my macOS apps are made for personal use by myself and my family simply because I have the skills to create them (and for fun, of course ðŸ˜Š). If my application has caused any harm, I apologize for that, but please be aware that you use it at your own risk.
